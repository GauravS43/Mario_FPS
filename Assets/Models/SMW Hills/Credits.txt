Tall Hill Background from Super Mario World

Model and textures made from scratch by Peardian using Cinema 4D and Fireworks.


Info:
I made this back in 2011 as an experiment in creating environment reflections.
Viewing the hills from the center of the map puts them in the same alignment as in the original game background.
The model can be repeated a total of 8 times to create a full circle.
